Make sure that you initially only do code/commit in your own Branch 
# When Committing
Create a pull request so people can review changes before committing
# Acessing Code
I copied all code from the main to your repo so copy that to become ur local repo that you work on
# Acessing other's code
Only copy from other people's repos if you want to access it DO NOT commit unless you ask the person
# Project
Use the project board I created to track work and needed changes
